Cafeteria Balance and Inventory Management System

This project aims to assist in the inventory control of school cafeterias. Through the system, it is possible to:




  Register products with expiration dates

  Record entries (purchases/receipts)
  
  Record exits (sales/consumption)

  Automatically calculate stock balance

  Generate alerts for products nearing expiration


          

The system helps prevent waste, improve product control, and ensure items are used before their expiration date.
